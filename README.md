# machine_learning
a collection of packages for ML projects, written in Tensorflow's Python API

To implement the neural speech decoders described in ["Machine translation of cortical activity to text with an encoder-decoder framework" (_Nature Neuroscience_, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0608-8), you probably also want to install the higher-level package, [`ecog2txt`](https://github.com/jgmakin/ecog2txt).

## Installation
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
git clone https://github.com/jgmakin/machine_learning.git
pip install -e machine_learning
```
